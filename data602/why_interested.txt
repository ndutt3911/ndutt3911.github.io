I'm interested in taking DATA 602 to refine my understanding of data science and its applications, especially considering how fast-evolving the field is. There are various interdisciplinary components that are a critical part of data science, and I want to learn those various pertaining skills while also understanding how the different components work together in data science. Eventually, I would like to take what I learn from this course and apply it in the data science industry.
